To run this you must prepare a workspace directory, (if you are ryan or nic this is as simple as running the first google docs section, and entering your name)
if you are however not nic or ryan, then in the directory first place Posts.xml, along with post_parser_record.py 
next create a file named Entities, then place Posts.py inside

once this is done run the code segments in order, again excluding the google docs section if you are in fact not nic or ryan.
